# EDC-Deployment
Scripts for EDC

From the author:
  I am not a full time dev. So with that being said there could be errors or bugs that I did not fore see. If any errors or bugs occur that you cannot resolve, please    send me a screenshot of the error or a detailed description of the bug. Thanks and good luck.

Installation:
  Make sure you have python installed. Obviously.
  Download the .py file.
  Ensure that the .py file has its own directory(folder).
  Inside the folder the .py file is located in, you will need 3 more directories(folders):<br>
  <br>
    - input<br>
    - output<br>
    - template<br>
  <br>
  Ensure folder names are exactly as stated above, otherwise errors will occur.(The reason for doing this is so the file names will not matter)
  The input folder will contain the csv file from the PcWin project.
  The template folder will contain the template excel file for importing events.
  The output will contain the file that the script edits.
